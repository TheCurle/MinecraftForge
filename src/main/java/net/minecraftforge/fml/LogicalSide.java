 *     sent over to the server, renders the viewport of the game, and maintains a copy of the world as dictated by the
 *     server's copy. </li>
 *     <li>{@link #SERVER} is the logical <em>server</em>, which runs seperately from the logical client. It listens
 *     for and establishes connections from logical clients, handles the game logic for the world, and maintains the
 *     authoritative copy of the world. </li>
 * </ul>

 * server and the logical client, while the {@linkplain Dist#DEDICATED_SERVER
 * dedicated server distribution}, as its name implies, only holds the logical server.
